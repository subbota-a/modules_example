# C++20 Modules Example Project

This project serves as a playground for experimenting with C++20 modules feature. C++20 modules represent a significant improvement in how we organize and structure C++ code, offering better compilation times and cleaner code organization compared to traditional header files.

## Overview

This is a simple project demonstrating the usage of C++20 modules. It's built using CMake and serves as a learning resource for understanding how modules work in modern C++.

## Prerequisites

- CMake (3.28 or newer)
- A C++23 compliant compiler with modules support
